Hello, Welcome to my Portfolio Website

Here, I just wanted to explain my design choices.

Font Choice:

I chose the Akira font because it adds a unique, modern feel to my website. The font is used throughout the logo, headers, and some text to emphasize its importance. 
For some of the additional text in the resume section and about me section, I used Helvetica since it also adds a modern touch and I didn't want to go overkill
using the Akira font, which could lessen the importance of some areas of text. Helvetica is a solid font that allows ease of reading, without taking away the 
focus on certain areas.


Color Palette:

In the color palette, I utilized black for the background, white for most text, and shades of purple to add color. 
I aimed to keep it minimal and simple by choosing less than 5 different colors. The high contrast allows for maximum readability/focus of text 
and choosing the main color as black provides less strain on the eyes. I chose to add purple since its associated with providing a soothing mood, works well with black, 
and doesn't add any strain to the reader.


Images:

Currently, there is only two different images on the website. In the future I'll be adding more for the projects section but due to time, I was not able to do so. 
One image is used for the logo "justin lee, experience architect." Utilizing an image allowed me for maintaining the white text when making the logo a home button,
without turning purple when hovered or clicked on. Another image is my profile photo. I felt having a face connected to the portfolio would add a personal feel 
and understanding to the users on who created the content. The facial image is greyscale to continue the style guide evident throughout the website.


Navigation Structure:

The navigation structure is simple. The logo of my name and title as the "back to home" button, following the links to the about, projects, resume, and contact button below.
When hovering over the about, projects, resume, and contact buttons, the color changes to a bright magenta to show that the user is about to change pages when clicked on.
The color magenta is also used to signify which page the user is on to prevent confusion for the user.


Layout:

The layout is minimal and simple. I wanted the focus to be on the content, utilizing the fonts to add a bit of flair. To do so, the black background allows 
focus on the contrasting colors, evident in the different types of text. The only page with bordered text is within the projects section because this will have a lot of 
different types and number of content. The purple bordered box maintains and distinguishes which lot of text is relevant to which project. In the future, there will be 
images for the respective case studies and projects, in addition to links to individual, more detailed pages about the certain project/case study.


CSS functionality:

I wanted to make sure this website could be easily accessible on web and mobile. To do so, I utilized class elements so that I could easily manipulate the structure of content.
For the css class elements, I made sure to use width, padding, and margins with percentages instead of pixels to allow for a responsive website. Doing so, I was able to 
use media inquries to differentiate the structure when the code detected a smaller width, allowing for different layout in mobile sizes. I was able to learn and research more
about this feature through my classmate's css presentations and search on youtube for more detailed tutorials. I replicated how the tutorials structured a website and learned
how I could manipluate/implement the code for the vision for my own website. While it took some time, I was able to easily figure out how certain elements work, learn new features 
of HTML/CSS, and build on my beginner level coding abilities. Also, I cross referenced the codes on various forums and on w3schools to reach the goal I hoped for. Previously, I had 
created websites that gave the looks I wanted but weren't responsive or aiding my skills in HTML /CSS. For example, I used IDs for each individual pages and elements, 
which made it very difficult to organize or redo certain areas. It was very static, unsustainable, and the code was very poor quality.
Overall, I'm very happy with how my website turned out and how I was able to expand my HTML/CSS knowledge.
